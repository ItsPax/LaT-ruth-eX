#NoCellOfALie

A C++ Truth Table Generator that generates the Truth Table syntax for LaTeX. Currently in Beta.

How to use:  
1. `git clone https://github.com/ItsPax/NoCellOfALie`
2. Type `cd NoCellOfALie/` to navigate to the directory where the source code is stored.
3. Type `make` to make the project.
4. Type `./solveEquation` and follow the instructions onscreen. For examples of the syntax, look to the examples below.

Bugs:  
`~(p and q) -> (~q or r)` does not currently work; I believe it's a problem with `std::string.substr()`. Try `str.substr(10,17)` while `string str = "false -> (~q or r)"`.  


Examples:
- `a`
- `~a`
- `a and b`
- `a or b`
- `a -> b`
- `(a and b) or (a and c)`
- `(~(a -> b) or ~(a and c or b))`
- `~(a and b -> c)`


The operators currently supported are:
- `and`, `or`, `->`, `<->` and `~`
To request for more operators, file it as an issue.

TODO:  
- Make a nice GUI or at least a better user interface than just having the user edit the equation 
- Build variable autorecognition instead of having the user add them
- Is it possible to query wolfram for the truth table and then compare the data received with the truth table generated by my checker as automated testing?
