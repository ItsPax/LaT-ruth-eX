#NoCellOfALie

A C++ Truth Table Generator that generates the Truth Table syntax for LaTeX. 

In beta, not ready for everyday use.  
How to use:  
1. Write your equation in solveEquation, write your assignments.
2. Run program.

TODO:  
1. Find a nice solution for integration of NOT  
2. Print out plaintext truth table  
3. Print out latex syntax for truth table  
4. Print out markdown syntax for truth table  
5. Make a nice GUI or at least a better user interface than just having the user edit the equation (some syntax checker would be nice if plausible)
