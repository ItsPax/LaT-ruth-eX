#NoCellOfALie

A C++ Truth Table Generator that generates the Truth Table syntax for LaTeX. 

In beta, not ready for everyday use.  
Functional but hard to use as of the moment.  
How to use:  
1. Write your equation in solveEquation, write your assignments.
2. Run program.

TODO:  
- Is it possible to query wolfram for the truth table and then compare the data received with the truth table generated by my checker as automated testing?
- Refactor code
- Print out latex syntax for truth table
- Print out markdown syntax for truth table
- Make a nice GUI or at least a better user interface than just having the user edit the equation (some syntax checker would be nice if plausible)
